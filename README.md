# BgSpider

A spider for http://blockgeek.org.


## Getting Started

The simple steps to get & run bgSpider are:

```
https://github.com/StormSpirit22/bgSpider
cd bgSpider
npm i
npm start
```


In **config.json**, I've set startPage to 1600 and endPage to 1870, means the number of post is from 1600 to 1870. And startDate is 2018-11-24 and endDate is 2018-12-01, which means posts started from 2018-11-24 00:00:00 ended to 2018-12-01 00:00:00 are valid. You can update these variables according to time.

Program run synchronously so maybe take sometime, wait for a minute will output two excels.
